KLT-based Algorithm for Registration of Images from Observing Systems (KARIOS)

## Introduction

In general, quality assessment process are fundamental to appreciate how well data fit for Earth Observation application purposes.
Those assessment dedicated to geometric accuracy are rarely opened to community. As consequence, it is always difficult to inter compare data based on the same process and it is always difficult to compare results based on harmonized mapping accuracy metrics.

To overcome this situation, thanks to funding of  ESA / EDAP [EDAP](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/activities/edap) project, the KARIOS initiative has been promoted and a user tool is now available.

The KARIOS tool has been designed to analyse geometric deformations within optical / radar images.  For this purpose, the tool performs image matching and generate several key graphical presentations and compute accuracy statistics.

Image matching process does not follow traditional approach because it is based on feature point matching (corner). A [KLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanade%E2%80%93Lucas%E2%80%93Tomasi_feature_tracker) implementation available in OpenCV library is used in KARIOS. Also, the Candidate point selection is done with GoodFeaturesToTrack function and matching is done  with calcOpticalFlowPyrLK function.

As show in the following picture, KARIOS makes KLT algorithm compatible with remote sensing images embedding suitable pre-processing (image filtering)  / post-processing (outlier filtering).

Furthermore, KARIOS analyses displacements between the two input image grids both in line and pixel direction outputing, providing user with the three following items:

### Geometric Error overview

![Geometric Error overview](docs/images/error_overview.PNG)

### Geometric accuracy report

![Geometric accuracy report](docs/images/statistical_report.PNG)

### Geometric distortion analysis report

![Geometric distortion analysis report](docs/images/disparity_map.PNG)

The geometric accuracy report includes the following accuracy metrics, in both directions when relevant:
- Root Mean Square Error
- Minimum / Maximum Error
- Mean Error
- Standard deviation Error
- Circular Error @90 percentile

> The Circular Error (CE) at the 90% level confidence graphic is used for horizontal accuracy in image products.  
> This representation is relevant for image expressed within cartographic system grid.  
> Because, with the CE representation, it is straightforward to evaluate mapping accuracy, considering reference data with known accuracy.
>
> Rather, in case of images with no cartographic system grid, the CE graphic representation becomes less informative.  
> The CE graphic is still generated, and equally spaced sample data is assumed.  
> This hypothesis is not obvious, when details on image grids are unknown.

## Prerequisite

This tool is a Python application, to run it you should have a dedicated conda environnement.

To do so, install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), then run the following command to create the _karios_ conda env

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then activate the env:

```bash
conda activate karios
```

## Usage

KARIOS takes as mandatory inputs :
- monitored sensor image file
- reference sensor image file

> Input files shall contain only one layer of data, and the format shall recognized by gdal library.

> **NOTICE**: Inputs images grids should be comparable.  
> That means geo coded images must have the same footprint, same geo transform information (same EPSG code) and same resolution. Image pixel resolution should also be square (same X,Y) and unit meter.

Sample:

```bash
python karios/karios.py \
    /data/12SYH/LS9_OLIL2F_20220824T175017_N0403_R035_T12SYH_20230214T164934.SAFE/GRANULE/L2F_T12SYH_A000000_20220824T175017_LS9_R035/IMG_DATA/L2F_T12SYH_20220824T175017_LS9_R035_B04_10m.TIF \
    /data/References/GRI/T12SYH_20220514T175909_B04.jp2

## Configuration

The default configuration is located in [karios/configuration/processing_configuration.json](karios/configuration/processing_configuration.json)

### klt_matching parameters

- `xStart` : image X margin to apply (margin is skipped by the matcher)
- `tile_size` : tile size to process by KTL in the input image
- `laplacian_kernel_size` : Aperture size used to compute the second-derivative filters of Laplacian process
-
The following parameter allows to control how to find the most prominent corners in the
reference image, as described by the OpenCV documentation goodFeaturesToTrack, after applying Laplacian.

- `minDistance` : Minimum possible Euclidean distance between the returned corners.
- `blocksize` : Size of an average block for computing a derivative covariation matrix over each pixel neighbourhood.
- `maxCorners` : Maximum number of corners to extract. If there are more corners than are found, the strongest of them is returned.
`maxCorners = 0` implies that no limit on the maximum is set and all detected corners are returned.
- `qualityLevel` : Parameter characterizing the minimal accepted quality of image corners.
The parameter value is multiplied by the best corner quality measure.
The corners with the quality measure less than the product are rejected.
For example, if the best corner has the quality measure = 1500, and the qualityLevel=0.01,
then all the corners with the quality measure less than 15 are rejected.
- `matching_winsize` : size of the search window during matching corners in the reference and the monitored Laplacian images.
- `outliers_filtering` : whether to filter or not the outliers points found during the matching.

## KLT param leverage

### maxCorners & tile_size

In order to have a lower memory usage during KLT process, it is possible to define a tile size to process for KLT.

For example, a tile_size of 10000 for an image having a size of 20000x20000 pixels will result of 4 tiles to process.

In this context, the KLT process will look in each tiles for `maxCorners`.

While an image of 20000x20000 pixels results of 4 equals tiles, an image of 20000x15000 pixels also result of 4 tiles, but with different size, two of 10000x10000 pixels and two of 10000x5000 pixels.

The consequence is that the density for matching point will not be the same each tiles, the bigger tiles will have a lower matching point than the smallest.

You may also consider that the image can content empty parts where KLT will not find any matching point. So tiles having a large empty parts will also results to a bigger matching point density.

In order to avoid density difference in the final result, you can define a `tile_size` largest than the image with an hight `maxCorners`, or a small `tile_size` and `maxCorners` in order to have tiles with almost same size.

For example, for image of 20000x15000 pixels, you should consider a `tile_size` of 20000 (1 tile), or 5000 (12 equal tiles)
