"""Runtime configuration module for KARIOS.

This module defines the RuntimeConfiguration dataclass which specifies how
KARIOS should process images, but not which specific images to process.
This separation allows the same configuration to be reused across multiple
image processing operations.

The configuration covers:
- Output settings (directory, file generation flags)
- Processing parameters (pixel size, large shift detection)
- Optional inputs (mask files, DEM files)
- Visualization options (title prefixes, DEM descriptions)

    """Runtime configuration for KARIOS processing behavior.

    This configuration defines how images should be processed, focusing purely
    on processing behavior and output settings. Input files (images, masks, DEMs)
    are provided separately to processing methods.

    Attributes:
        output_directory: Directory where results will be written
        pixel_size: Optional pixel size in meters. Ignored if image resolution
                   can be read from input images
        title_prefix: Optional prefix for chart titles (max 26 characters)
        gen_kp_mask: Whether to generate a TIFF mask based on key points
        gen_delta_raster: Whether to generate intermediate products (dx/dy raster)
        dem_description: Optional DEM source description for plots
        enable_large_shift_detection: Whether to detect and correct large pixel shifts
